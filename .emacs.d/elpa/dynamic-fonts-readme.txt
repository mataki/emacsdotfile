Quickstart

    (require 'dynamic-fonts)

    (dynamic-fonts-setup)     ; finds "best" fonts and sets faces:
                              ; default, fixed-pitch, variable-pitch

Explanation

Dynamic-fonts.el makes font configuration more portable between
machines.  When Emacs is starting up, dynamic-fonts chooses fonts
for your basic faces based on which fonts are actually available
on your system.

You may set a list of fonts in order of preference using customize.

Bugs

    Checking for font availability is slow on most systems.  This
    library can add up to several seconds to startup time.
    Workaround: where supported, font information will be cached
    to disk.  See customization options for font-utils.
